    <span class="biotext">
        Pianist and composer Michael McNeill works in the areas of jazz, classical music, "new" music, and in music that crosses and breaks through those stylistic boundaries. His recent CD releases with his own trio (with veteran improvisers Ken Filiano and Phil Haynes), the chamber-jazz quartet resAUnance, and the Buffalo Jazz Octet, have drawn praise from critics in the US and abroad. He's a founding member of the Wooden Cities New Music Collective and the Buffalo Bach Project. Other collaborations of note have included performances with cornetist/composer/conductor Taylor Ho Bynum, the masterful improvising trumpeter Paul Smoker, and the virtuoso bass-trombonist David Taylor.</span></p></div>
